Purchase Recommendation:
Based on the provided data:

* Current Price: £83.68 (below 50-day MA of £90.89)
* Trend: DOWNWARD

I would recommend **WAIT** for now.

The downward trend and current price being below the 50-day moving average suggest that the market is currently in a bearish phase. Buying additional shares at this point may not be the best decision, as it's uncertain whether the stock will continue its downtrend or stabilize soon.

However, if you're looking to add to your position, consider waiting for a pullback towards the 50-day MA or another significant support level before adding more funds. This can help minimize potential losses and potentially increase returns in the long run.
